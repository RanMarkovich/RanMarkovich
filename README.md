### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ran Markovich

I'm a **DevOps Engineer at AppsFlyer**, passionate about building efficient, automated, and reliable systems.

Between **2017 and 2025**, I evolved through roles in **QA and Automation Engineering**, collaborating closely with developers and product teams to uphold high standards of quality and stability. Along the way, I discovered a love for teaching-especially Pythonâ€”and even led a QA team before fully transitioning into DevOps.

ðŸ’¡ Over the years, I found myself setting up infrastructure in places where DevOps resources were scarce. That hands-on experience helped me bridge the gap between QA, development, and operations, shaping the DevOps mindset I apply today.

ðŸ”§ I thrive on:
- Building scalable CI/CD pipelines
- Automating repetitive workflows
- Diving deep into complex systems and solving them with the right tools
- Bringing cross-disciplinary insight to engineering challenges

### ðŸ§ª DevOpsLabs â€“ My Ongoing Hands-On DevOps Project

I'm currently working on a long-term project hosted under the [**DevOpsLabs** GitHub organization](https://github.com/RanM-DevOpsLabs), where I experiment with and showcase different DevOps concepts in a modular, practical way.

Each repository in DevOpsLabs is focused on a specific domain or use caseâ€”covering areas like:
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform
- **CI/CD pipelines**
- **Kubernetes environments**
- **Monitoring & Observability**
- **Cloud-native patterns**
- and more...

It's an evolving lab designed for continuous learning, testing tools, and building real-world-ready setups.
