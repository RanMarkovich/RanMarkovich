### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ran Markovich

I'm a **DevOps Engineer at AppsFlyer**, passionate about building efficient, automated, and reliable systems.

Between **2017 and 2025**, I evolved through roles in **QA and Automation Engineering**, collaborating closely with developers and product teams to uphold high standards of quality and stability. Along the way, I discovered a love for teaching - especially Python - and even led a QA team before fully transitioning into DevOps.

ðŸ’¡ Over the years, I found myself setting up infrastructure in places where DevOps resources were scarce. That hands-on experience helped me bridge the gap between QA, development, and operations, shaping the DevOps mindset I apply today.

ðŸ”§ I thrive on:
- Building scalable CI/CD pipelines
- Automating repetitive workflows
- Diving deep into complex systems and solving them with the right tools
- Bringing cross-disciplinary insight to engineering challenges

ðŸ“« Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ranmarkovich) or reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate, learn more about my journey, or just chat over coffee â˜•
